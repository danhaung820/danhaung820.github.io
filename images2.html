    <h2>Menmen's naughty diary</h2>  
    <p>In a quiet and warm town, there lives an ocelot named Menmen. Menmen is different from other cats, he has a smooth silky leopard fur, and his eyes are always shining with curiosity and mischief. But the biggest headache for his owner is his little habit of biting people.
        The master of the door was a kind and patient man, and he knew that the door was just natural and did not really want to hurt him. So, he decided to start a battle of wits and courage with Menmen to see who could win in this game.
        The owner first tried various methods, such as using toys to attract Doorman's attention or calming him with catnip. But Menmun always seems to be able to skillfully avoid these traps and continue its naughty behavior. Whenever it has a lot of fun, it will bite the owner unexpectedly, and then quickly escape, leaving the owner in place can not smile.
        However, the owner did not give up. He began to observe Menmen's behavior more carefully, trying to find its weakness. After a long time of observation, the owner found that the door door always made a special snoring sound before biting people. The owner was so excited by this discovery that he immediately thought of a countermeasure.
        When the door made that snoring sound again, the owner quickly picked up a toy mouse and dangled it in front of the door. Sure enough, the attention of the door was immediately attracted to the past, it forgot the matter of biting people, began to chase the toy mouse. Looking at the excited play of the door, the master could not help laughing out.
        As time went on, Menmen seemed to gradually understand their master's intentions. He began to become more obedient and less likely to bite. The master also learned how to get along with men, and the tacit understanding and friendship between them became more profound.
        Although in this battle of wits and courage, the master seems to "lose" to the door, but in fact, the relationship between them has become more harmonious. Menmen has also grown from a mischievous little cat to a smart and lovely family member.</p>
